# LotteryStats
Personal lottery tells the user wether they could have won the lottery with a certain budget, had they tried the numbers generated by the machine

This Go project proceeds to show how unlikely it is to win the Lottery, it accepts the user's budget and type of Lottery, randomly picks numbers and tells the user whether one of the numbers have won, usually no winning happens with a budget below $10M (slightly more likely at $10M)
